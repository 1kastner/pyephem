<b>Update (4 March 2003):</b>
After several years of neglecting this project
I have finally updated it
so that it should work with modern versions of Python,
and so that it uses the now-standard distutils installation method.
While I am rather appalled by the condition of the programming interface,
it might not be without further encouragement
that I attempt more thorough improvements.

PyEphem is a module
for performing astronomical computations from the Python scripting language.
Its primary purpose is to compute
for an arbitrary date and location on earth
the position of the sun, moon, a planet,
or any asteroid or comet whose orbital elements are available.
Additional functions are also included,
including facilities
to compute the angular separation between two objects in the sky,
to determine the constellation in which an object lies,
and to find the times at which
any object rises, transits, and sets on a particular day.
