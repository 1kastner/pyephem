<b>Update (22 April 2003):</b>
<a href="pyephem-3.5.2b2.tar.gz">PyEphem version 3.5.2b2</a>
resolves further problems with Windows compilation
and users now report that the module works under Windows.
Also the manual under doc/pyephem-manual.html has been updated;
the last two releases accidentally included the old version instead.
<p>
<b>Update (21 April 2003):</b>
<a href="pyephem-3.5.2b1.tar.gz">PyEphem version 3.5.2b1</a>
removes several problems with compiling under Windows.
<p>
<b>Completely New Version! (20 April 2003):</b>
The previous version of PyEphem was too painfully awkward
for me to leave it alone,
so I have rewritten it entirely.
The <a href="pyephem-3.5.2b.tar.gz">new version 3.5.2b</a> is now available
(denoting the second PyEphem version released
while XEphem remains at version 3.5.2),
and you can check out its much improved interface
through the extensive tutorial in the new
<a href="pyephem-manual.html">manual</a>.
<p>
<b>Update (4 March 2003):</b>
After several years of neglecting this project
I have finally updated it
so that it should work with modern versions of Python,
and so that it uses the now-standard distutils installation method.
While I am rather appalled by the condition of the programming interface,
it might not be without further encouragement
that I attempt more thorough improvements.
The new version is <a href="pyephem-3.5.2a.tar.gz">3.5.2a</a>.

<b>PyEphem</b> provides scientific-grade astronomical computations
for the <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> programming language.
It can compute for arbitrary dates and locations
the positions of the sun, moon, and planets,
and any asteroids, comets, or earth satellites
whose orbital elements are available.
Additional functions can compute the angular separation
between two objects in the sky,
determine the constellation in which an object lies,
and find the times at which
an object rises, transits, and sets on a particular day.

<h2>Catalogues</h2>
After learning to program with PyEphem
you will probably want to download the orbital elements
of comets or asteroids that interest you,
or perhaps coordinates for stars and other fixed objects.
Here are several sources from which such data may be obtained:

<dl>
<dt>
<a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Soft03.html"
>http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Soft03.html</a>
<dd>
The International Astronomical Union's
<i>Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams and Minor Planet Center</i>
is where comet and asteroid discoveries are traditionally reported,
and is a source of ephemerides and orbital elements for these objects.
They provide updated orbital elements, in ephem format,
for many currently visible comets and asteroids.
<dt>
<a href="http://celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/"
>http://celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/</a>
<dd>
Orbital elements for man-made earth satellites are available from NORAD,
whose Two-Line Element format can be understood
by PyEphem's <tt>readtle()</tt> function.
<dt><a href="http://www.maa.mhn.de/Tools/Xephem/"
>http://www.maa.mhn.de/Tools/Xephem/</a>
<dd>
This directory has not been updated for several years,
but has quite extensive collections of objects in ephem format.
Though many of its comet and asteroid elements are doubtless out of date,
its files of fixed objects from galaxies to pulsars
should remain valuable.
<dt>
<a href="http://toyvax.glendale.ca.us/"
>http://toyvax.glendale.ca.us/</a>
<dd>
This page has elements in ephem format
for several of our longer-lived space probes.
