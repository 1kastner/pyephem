<p>
<b>PyEphem</b> provides scientific-grade astronomical computations
for the <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> programming language.
Given a date and location on the Earth's surface,
it can compute the positions of the Sun and Moon,
of the planets and their moons,
and of any asteroids, comets, or earth satellites
whose orbital elements the user can provide.
Additional functions are provided to compute the angular separation
between two objects in the sky,
to determine the constellation in which an object lies,
and to find the times at which
an object rises, transits, and sets on a particular day.
</p>
<p>
(In case you need it, a previous version is still available
<a href="pyephem-3.6.4a.tar.gz">here</a>.)

<h2>Resources</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="pyephem-manual.html">PyEphem Manual</a>
 is the authoritative guide to programming with PyEphem.
 If you download the source distribution from the link above,
 the manual is included,
 along with a few short sample programs in the <tt>examples/</tt> directory.
<li>PyEphem now includes a
 <tt><a href="pyephem-CHANGELOG">CHANGELOG</a></tt>
 which records in more detail the differences between versions.
<li>You can learn more about and download the wonderful
 <a href="http://www.clearskyinstitute.com/xephem/">XEphem</a> application
 from which PyEphem derives its computation engine;
 it has long been written and maintained by

<h2><a name="catalogues">Catalogues</a></h2>
After learning to program with PyEphem
you will probably want to download the orbital elements
of comets or asteroids that interest you,
or perhaps coordinates for stars and other fixed objects.
Here are several sources from which such data may be obtained:

<dl>
<dt>
<a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Soft03.html"
>http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Soft03.html</a>
<dd>
The International Astronomical Union's
<i>Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams and Minor Planet Center</i>
is where comet and asteroid discoveries are traditionally reported,
and is a source of ephemerides and orbital elements for these objects.
They provide updated orbital elements, in ephem format,
for many currently visible comets and asteroids.
<dt>
<a href="http://celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/"
>http://celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/</a>
<dd>
Orbital elements for man-made earth satellites are available from NORAD,
whose Two-Line Element format can be understood
by PyEphem's <tt>readtle()</tt> function.
<dt><a href="http://www.maa.mhn.de/Tools/Xephem/"
>http://www.maa.mhn.de/Tools/Xephem/</a>
<dd>
This directory has not been updated for several years,
but has quite extensive collections of objects in ephem format.
Though many of its comet and asteroid elements are doubtless out of date,
its files of fixed objects like galaxies to pulsars
should remain valuable.
<dt>
<a href="http://toyvax.glendale.ca.us/"
>http://toyvax.glendale.ca.us/</a>
<dd>
This page has elements in ephem format
for several of our longer-lived space probes.
