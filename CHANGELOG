Version 3.6.1a

  - All major moons in the solar system are now supported.

  - Added copy() method to bodies, that returns a new instance of the
    body which should be identical in all properties.

  - Improved the definitions of body attributes, both in their
    docstrings and in the PyEphem Manual.

  - Improved access to the orbital parameters by which the user
    defines bodies in ellipical, parabolic, and hyperbolic orbits, as
    well as artificial Earth satellites; users can now create such
    objects entirely through setting their parameters, without having
    to use the readdb() function to parse a definition of the object
    in Ephem database format.

  - Source distribution now includes test suites, one of which
    actually checks to see whether your version of PyEphem produces
    the same output as the examples from the PyEphem Manual (two of
    which will fail).

  - Following the same adjustment in the XEphem application, PyEphem
    now uses a default atmospheric pressure of 1010 millibar, rather
    than the old value of 1013, when computing the altitude of a body
    near the horizon.

  - The constellation() function now correctly forces the computation
    of a body's ra and dec before determining the constellation in
    which the body lies.

  - Code should produce cleaner compiles on many platforms.
