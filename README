PyEphem
Version 3.6.1a
24 October 2004

PyEphem provides an `ephem' module providing many astronomical
computation routines accessible from the Python scripting language.
You can find the most recent version at

   http://www.rhodesmill.org/brandon/projects/pyephem.html

The computation routines behind PyEphem were extracted from the XEphem
program of Elwood Charles Downey (ecdowney@ClearSkyInstitute.com),
available from http://iraf.noao.edu/~ecdowney/xephem.html.

See the COPYING file in this directory for copyright information.

INSTALLING

Building and installing this module requires Python, your C compiler,
and the standard Python distutils.  You can run the setup.py script in
this directory to build or install the package.  Typically, entering

	python setup.py install

(which you will probably need to do as root, unless you have Python
installed in your home directory) will both build and install the
module, which you can use in your Python programs with either an

	import ephem

or perhaps a

	from ephem import *

The scripts in the examples/ directory might help you learn how to use
PyEphem, and also to test whether it is running properly on your
system.

DOCUMENTATION

See the manual under doc/pyephem-manual.html and look online at
http://www.rhodesmill.org/brandon/projects/pyephem for a description
of programming with PyEphem.

CONTRIBUTING

If you write useful scripts with PyEphem, please consider submitting
them to be considered for the `examples/' directory.  In particular,
there will probably be interest in algorithms that search for various
celestial circumstances, like eclipses or conjunctions; not needing
such routines myself, however, I have not endeavored to produce any.
