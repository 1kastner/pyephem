PyEphem
Version 3.5.2a
4 March 2003

PyEphem provides an `ephem' module providing many astronomical
computation routines accessible from the Python scripting language.
It is written and maintained by Brandon Craig Rhodes, whom you can
find at:

	brandon@rhodesmill.org
	http://www.rhodesmill.org/brandon/

The computation routines themselves were extracted from the XEphem
program of Elwood Charles Downey (ecdowney@ClearSkyInstitute.com),
available from http://iraf.noao.edu/~ecdowney/xephem.html.

See the COPYING file in this directory for copyright information.

INSTALLING

Change directory to pyephem-3.5.2a and use the setup.py script to
build or install the package.  Typically, entering

	python setup.py install

(which you will probably need to do as root, unless you have your own
version of Python in your home directory) will both build and install
the module, which you can use in your Python programs with either an

	import ephem

or perhaps a

	from ephem import *

The scripts in the examples/ directory might help you learn how to use
PyEphem, and also to test whether it is running properly on your
system.

DOCUMENTATION

See the manual under doc/pyephem-manual.html and look online at
http://www.rhodesmill.org/brandon/projects/pyephem for information
about programming with PyEphem.

CONTRIBUTING

If you write useful scripts with PyEphem, please consider submitting
them to be considered for the `examples/' directory.  In particular,
there will probably be interest in algorithms that search for various
celestial circumstances like eclipses or conjunctions; not needing
such routines myself, however, I have not endeavored to produce any.
