The following modifications to this copy of libastro were performed by
Brandon Craig Rhodes while developing PyEphem:

The pref_get function in aux.c was commented out so it could be
replaced by a pref_get function whose preferences could be modified
from within Python.

The constel.c file was moved into the library from the interface code.

Also:

The dm_separation function was copied from the XEphem datamenu.c file
into the ephem.m4 source file.
